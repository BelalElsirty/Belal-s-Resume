<p> "Hi there! I'm Belal Elsirty, hailing from the vibrant city of New Cairo, Egypt. Currently, I'm pursuing my studies at the Arab Academy for Science, Technology & Maritime Transport (AASTMT), diving deep into the realm of Computer Science. 
With a keen interest in technology and innovation, I'm always eager to explore new concepts and tackle challenging problems head-on.
Beyond academics, I'm also known for my prowess in swimming; it's not just a hobby, it's a passion! Whether gliding through the water or perfecting my technique, 
the pool has always been my second home. I've competed in numerous swimming events, honing not only my physical skills but also my mental resilience and determination.
Alongside hitting the pool, I find solace in fitness activities, constantly pushing my limits to stay in top shape. From strength training to cardio workouts, I believe in maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle to fuel both my body and mind.
And when I'm not submerged in water or breaking a sweat, you can find me unleashing my creative side through drawing, where every stroke tells a story. 
Art has been a constant source of inspiration and expression for me, allowing me to capture emotions and experiences on paper in ways words cannot.
Additionally, I find joy in playing the piano, losing myself in the melodies that resonate with my soul. Whether classical compositions or modern tunes, music has the power to transport me to another world and evoke a range of emotions.
Life's a canvas, and I'm here to make it colorful, one stroke, one stroke, one key at a time! I'm passionate about seizing every opportunity to learn, grow, and make a positive impact on the world around me."
